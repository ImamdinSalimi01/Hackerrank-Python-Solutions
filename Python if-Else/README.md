### Task
Given an integer, , perform the following conditional actions:
- If `n` is odd, print `Weird`
- If `n` is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5 , print `Not Weird`
- If `n` is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print `Weird`
- If `n` is even and greater than 20 , print `Not Weird`
### Input Format 
A single line containing a positive integer, `n`.
### Output Format
Print `Weird` if the number is weird. Otherwise, print `Not Weird`.

### Sample Input 0
```
3
```
### Sample Output 0

24
```
