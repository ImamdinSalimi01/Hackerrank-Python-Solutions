# Welcome to the first challenge

Here is a sample line of code that can be executed in Python: 
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
You can just as easily store a string as a variable and then print it to stdout: 
```python
my_string = "Hello, World!"
print(my_string)
```
The above code will print `Hello, World!` on your screen. Try it yourself in the editor. <br />

### Input Format 
You do not need to read any input in this challenge.
### Output Format
Print `Hello, World!` to stdout.

### Sample Output

Hello, World!
